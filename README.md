Welcome to LMFM4U(Let Me Fix Messenger For You)

Q: Why did you create this amazing script?
A: Well, I assume you all know, you can ask Facebook to send you an email containt ALL(yes, ALL) your information since you created your account, so being, all the messages you've sent and recieved throughout the years. They send you the messages either in HTML or JSON file, gigantic files which takes ages to load (Assuming you're not using an SSD, which still, could take a while) in our browsers. So the first thing we do is open the HTML in plain text, which is just AIDS, we get all the DIV tags and all the HTML we could possible NOT want (A conversation with one of my best friends had over 58 MILLION character) most of them were annoying HTML tags and it all looked ugly and not formatted, So that why I created this script. 

Q: What does this amazing script do?
A: This AMAZING script asks you kindly to select one of those messenger downloaded files(HTML file) and then proceeds to delete all the annoying HTML tags, shitty CSS styles at the start and formats the messages in a pretty way that is much more pleasurable to watch, its the perfect thing if you're lookign for something you said a LONG time ago on a certain conversation, or if you just want to send all your messages into an array (but why would you even do that??) 

How to use this amazing script

1. run Python MessengerFix.py
2. select the HTML file you want to beautify
3. get the beautified version on your desktop :)
4. forget to complain about now allowing you to choose a location.
